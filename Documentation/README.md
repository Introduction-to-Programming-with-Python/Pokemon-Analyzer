# Pokemon Analyzer

This project aims to apply some programming foundations concepts and Python functionalities applied to a pokemon analyzer which based on some pokemon data answer to requirments about this data.

## Respository structure

- The folder [Code](/Code/) contains the code.
- The folder [Documentation](/Documentation/) contains the repository documentation files and context about this project.
- The folder [Data](/Data/) contains the data soruces for this project.

## Statement

This [document](/Documentation/statement.pdf) contains the context of the problem, requirments and functionality for each file and function.

## Objectives

This project aims to apply the following functionalities:

- Read and process CSV files in Python
- Make partial and total tours on lists
- Use dictionary lists

## How does it work?

The file [pokemon_funciones.py](/Code/pokemon_funciones.py) has the necessary functions to perform the requirments. The file [pokemon_consola.py](/Code/pokemon_consola.py) execute the functions of the file [pokemon_funciones.py](/Code/pokemon_funciones.py) that solve the requirments in a linear mode without functions and without inputs and show in consoloe the information required.

## Execution

To execute the program you have to execute the [pokemon_consola.py](/Code/pokemon_consola.py) file.
